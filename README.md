# contacts

Sails example project

- Description of the problem and solution.

The problem was create a simple contacts app. It should have a list of contacts and a form to create a new one.

- Reasoning behind your technical choices, including architectural trade-offs you might have made, anything you left out, or what you might do differently if you were to spend additional time on the project.

About the technical choices, in the backend I used sails.js. That was a request from the client. 
In the frontend I used react.js.
Maybe in the backend I would use a framework that I used previosly like express or RoR. In the frontend I used react as a personal choice. I didn't work with it previosly, so I wanted to create an app with it.
I think I could spend more time in the frontend UI.

- Link to other code you're particularly proud of.

In frontend, I like this project https://github.com/vilcabamba/batusay-frontend since it has a lot of good practices.
In backend, I like this one https://github.com/fabricioflores/dumb-express-ssl/blob/master/server.js it is very simple, but was a solution for a big problem, so instead of using nginx and a lot of config, I created a simple proxy with node.
